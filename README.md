This miniapp to store a name and numbers of user
This app was created to store names and numbers of users in a JSON file. First we check if JSON exists or not; if not, we create it. Next you will have a choice when 1 - add contacts, 2 - show all, 3 - search, and 4 - exit. Their simple choice doesn't need to be described. After we add contacts, it's saving in our JSON file.
